# VideoFrameExtractor
More instructions later, but for the not faint at heart who know python.
a. create a folder
b. do a git clone from this repo
c. open the folder in visual studio
d. create a virtual environment
e. activate that environment
f. install the requirments (google install requirements.txt python)
g. type streamlit run .\app.py (or whatever your relative path is)

If everything worked a web window will start, you can drap a video file on the 
drag spot, and after a few moments the first and last frame of the video will be
extracted.
