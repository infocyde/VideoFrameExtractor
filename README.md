# VideoFrameExtractor

More instructions later, but for the not faint at heart who know python.

1. create a folder
2. do a git clone from this repo
3. open the folder in visual studio
4. create a virtual environment
5. activate that environment
6. install the requirements (google install requirements.txt python)
7. type `streamlit run .\app.py` (or whatever your relative path is)

If everything worked a web window will start, you can drag a video file on the drag spot, and after a few moments the first and last frame of the video will be extracted.
